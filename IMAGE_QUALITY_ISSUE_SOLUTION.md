# Image Quality Issues - Solutions

## The Problem
AI-generated images using Pollinations AI are producing bizarre, inappropriate, or confusing results (like the "WOW" image showing strange cartoon characters).

## Why This Happens
- **Pollinations AI** is free but unpredictable
- Abstract words (like "wow", "happy", "big") are hard for AI to visualize
- AI doesn't understand educational context
- No quality control on generated images

## Solutions (Ranked by Effectiveness)

### 1. **Use Your Own Teaching Materials (BEST)**
You mentioned having hundreds of simple images. This is the best approach:

**Steps:**
1. Go to Admin Panel → Manage Images
2. Use "Bulk Upload Images" section
3. Name files as: `word.png` (e.g., `cat.png`, `dog.png`, `house.png`)
4. Upload all at once

**Benefits:**
- ✓ You control quality
- ✓ Consistent style
- ✓ Educationally appropriate
- ✓ Free (your existing materials)
- ✓ No copyright issues if you created them

### 2. **Switch to DALL-E (Better Quality, Costs Money)**
Use OpenAI's DALL-E instead of free Pollinations:
- Better quality, more reliable
- Costs ~$0.02 per image (512x512)
- Already have OpenAI API key configured

### 3. **Use Free Image Sources**
Download from:
- **OpenClipart.org** - Public domain clipart (BEST for education)
- **Pixabay** - Free illustrations
- **Wikimedia Commons** - Public domain

### 4. **Review & Replace Bad Images**
New admin tool to:
- See all word images
- Flag bad ones
- Upload replacements
- Regenerate with better prompts

## Immediate Action
**Upload your teaching materials!** This will solve 90% of the problem and give students consistent, appropriate images.
